<img src="logo.png" alt="BikeControl Logo"/>

## Description

With BikeControl you can **control your favorite trainer app** using your Zwift Click, Zwift Ride, Zwift Play, Shimano Di2, or other similar devices. Here's what you can do with it, depending on your configuration:
- Add Virtual Shifting for trainer apps that do not support it natively
- Adjust Virtual Shifting to your liking: change the number of gears, adjust the gear ratios, and more
- Steering / navigation
- adjust workout intensity
- control music on your device
- create screenshots or launch any command / shortcut
- gestures: single click, double click, long press, etc. can be configured to do different things
- more? If you can do it via keyboard, mouse, or touch, you can do it with BikeControl

You can also connect your smart trainer directly to BikeControl to:
- Add virtual shifting capability if your trainer app doesn't support it
- Adjust virtual shifting gears to your liking
- Direct gear / intensity / mode changes via your controller
- Start a mini workout
- Proxy to WiFi

You can even try it out in your [Browser](https://openbikecontrol.github.io/bikecontrol/), if it supports Bluetooth connections. No controlling possible, though.

## Help
Check the troubleshooting guide [here](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## How does it work?
The app connects to your Controller devices (such as Zwift ones) automatically. BikeControl uses different methods of connecting to the trainer app, depending on the trainer app and operating system:
- Connect to the trainer app on the same device or on another device using Network
    - available on Android, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Windows
    - supported by e.g. MyWhoosh, Rouvy and Zwift
- Connect to the trainer app on another device by simulating a Bluetooth device
  - available on Android, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Windows
  - supported by e.g. Rouvy and Zwift
- Directly control the trainer app via Accessibility features (simulating touch and keyboard input)
  - available on Android, macOS, Windows
  - supported by all trainer apps
- Connect to the supported trainer app using the [OpenBikeControl](https://openbikecontrol.org) protocol
  - available on Android, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Windows

## Fork Information

This is a **non-commercial fork** of [BikeControl](https://github.com/OpenBikeControl/bikecontrol) that removes all commercial dependencies (Supabase, RevenueCat, in-app purchases, etc.) and provides free access to all pro features.

### What's Different
- All pro features permanently unlocked
- No subscription required
- No account/login required
- Works offline (no external service dependencies)
- CI builds for Windows, Android, and iOS (sideload)

### What's Removed
- Supabase backend (auth, sync, entitlements)
- RevenueCat (iOS/Android IAP)
- Windows Store IAP
- Google Sign-In / Apple Sign-In
- Shorebird (OTA updates)
- In-app purchase, review, update packages

### Upstream Compatibility
This fork maintains compatibility with the upstream project. See [FORK_MERGE.md](FORK_MERGE.md) for instructions on merging updates.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Flutter 3.44.1 (`flutter --version`)
- Android Studio / Xcode / Visual Studio (depending on target platform)

### Windows
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build windows --debug --dart-define=NO_COMMERCIAL=true
```
Output: `build/windows/x64/runner/Debug/bike_control.exe`

### Android
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug --dart-define=NO_COMMERCIAL=true
```
Output: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`

### iOS (Sideload)
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign --dart-define=NO_COMMERCIAL=true
```
Output: `build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app`

To create an .ipa for sideloading:
```bash
mkdir -p Payload
cp -r build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app Payload/
zip -r BikeControl.ipa Payload/
```

### NO_COMMERCIAL Flag
The `--dart-define=NO_COMMERCIAL=true` flag is **required** for all builds. This flag:
- Disables Supabase initialization
- Uses NoopIAPManager (all pro features unlocked)
- Removes network calls to commercial services
- Shows "All features unlocked" in subscription pages

Without this flag, the app will attempt to connect to commercial services and may fail.

## CI/CD

This fork includes GitHub Actions workflows that build the app for all platforms:
